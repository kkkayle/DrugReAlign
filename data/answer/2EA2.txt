### Detailed Analysis of the Receptor's Summary Information

1. **PDB ID:** 2EA2
2. **Title:** h-MetAP2 complexed with A773812
3. **Classification:** HYDROLASE
4. **Organism(s):** Homo sapiens
5. **Expression System:** Escherichia coli

MetAP2 stands for Methionine aminopeptidase 2, which is an enzyme that removes the N-terminal methionine from newly synthesized proteins. Human MetAP2 has been targeted for its role in angiogenesis and cancer, making it a protein of interest for drug targeting. The structure is expressed in Escherichia coli for experimental purposes.

### Spatial Structure of the Pocket-Ligand Interaction

The detailed spatial interaction between the ligand and protein pocket reveals important hydrophobic interactions and a hydrogen bond. These interactions are crucial for the binding affinity and specificity of the ligand to the receptor.

**Hydrophobic Interactions:**
- Significant hydrophobic interactions with residues like Leucine (LEU), Phenylalanine (PHE), Alanine (ALA), Tyrosine (TYR), and Isoleucine (ILE) in various positions. These residues are situated within close proximity (~3.5-4 Å) of the ligand, promoting a strong hydrophobic environment favorable for ligand binding.

**Hydrogen Bond:**
- A critical hydrogen bond is formed between Histidine (HIS) residue at position A and ligand F77, with a donor-acceptor distance of 3.61 Å and a donor angle of 156.85°. This bond enhances the specificity and stability of the ligand-receptor complex.
