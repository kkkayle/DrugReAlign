1,Bestatin,"Bestatin is a known inhibitor of aminopeptidases including MetAP2. It forms strong hydrophobic interactions and a hydrogen bond, similar to A773812."
2,Fumagillin,"Fumagillin targets MetAP2 by forming covalent bonds, affecting angiogenesis, and is indicated for its potent inhibitory effects."
3,TNP-470,"TNP-470 is a synthetic derivative of fumagillin that inhibits MetAP2, displaying strong hydrophobic interactions with similar residues as found in 2EA2."
4,Beloranib,Beloranib is an anti-obesity drug that inhibits MetAP2. Its hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding properties align well with the binding pocket characteristics.
5,PPI-2458,"PPI-2458 is an investigational drug that targets MetAP2, using a mechanism involving hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding, potentially interacting with residues similar to those in 2EA2."
