2. Spatial Structure of the Pocket-Ligand Interaction:
- The interaction between the ligand and protein pocket is mainly hydrophobic, with residues such as TYR, ALA, GLN, TRP, and ILE involved in close contact. 
- There are also hydrogen bond interactions between ALA, GLY, THR, and ASP residues of the receptor and ligand. 
- Pi-stacking interactions are observed with residues TYR in both Chain A and Chain B.
