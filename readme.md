This guide outlines the process for utilizing your own data in drug repositioning projects. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and run analyses with custom datasets.

## System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Python Version:** 3.7.16
- **Required Libraries:**
  - numpy==1.21.5
  - pandas==1.3.5
  - plip==2.3.0
  - beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
  - requests==2.31.0
  - openai==1.12.0

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that the required libraries are installed in your Python environment.
2. Download the necessary PDB (Protein Data Bank) file, ensuring it includes a sample small molecule ligand binding, and the corresponding FASTA file.
3. Locate and modify the relevant file paths in the `DrugReAlign.ipynb` file according to your dataset.
4. Execute the notebook to run the analysis.
5. Results will be saved in the `./answer/` directory for further review.

# Experimental Data and Interpretation

## Download

Experimental data is available for download from the provided link. Navigate to the [Experimental Data](https://github.com/kkkayle/DrugReAlign/tree/master/Experimental%20data) directory.

## Data Structure and Interpretation

The experimental data is organized as follows:
```
ðŸ“‚ Experimental data
  â”£ ðŸ“‚ LLMs_Answers (Subject experimental data in the paper)
  â”£ ðŸ“‚ Docking_results (Molecular docking conducted in the main experiment and the spatial information removal experiment)
  â”£ ðŸ“‚ Ablation (Results from LLMs with spatial information removed and predictions from traditional deep learning models)
    â”£ ðŸ“‚ newbing
    â”£ ðŸ“‚ gpt4
    â”£ ðŸ“‚ gpt3
    â”£ ðŸ“‚ DL_Answers
      â”£ ðŸ“‚ TransformerCPI2.0 (Model's prediction results)
      â”£ ðŸ“‚ Drugban (Model's prediction results)
      â”— ðŸ“‚ DL_docking_results (Docking results of the models mentioned above)
```
